# Collaboration
This project is about collaboration initiatives of Darwinia network.



Darwinia is committed to creating a polkadot parachain for user-facing blockchain application developers, and Darwinia is also a community project. Darwinia encourages community developers to contribute to the prosperity of the Darwinia ecosystem. To this end, Darwinia launches a community developer incentive program.
The Community Developer Incentive Program is divided into two parts: [Grant Program](./grant/README.md) and the [Bounty Program](./bounty/README.md).
